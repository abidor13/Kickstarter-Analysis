# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
## Performing an analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends for Louise's upcoming Campaign.
In this module we performed data analysis on some crowdfunding projects to help Louise understand plan and budget her upcoming play “Fever”. Our expectation was to be able to provide Louis with some key factors to make her fundraising campaign a successful one. To do so, we analyzed several other campaigns that were in place to help launch similar plays. 
Louise is interested in starting a campaign for theater, specifically a play. The data provided shows that the months of May and June had the most successful fundraising campaigns for plays.

However, launching Kickstarter campaigns in the months of January, June, July and October had a higher number of failed campaigns.
Plays like Foresight and Walken on Sunshine were both successful, able to reach their campaign goal and even exceed it. So maybe these are couple of plays that Louise should be looking into and trying to mirror their steps in order to be as successful, Walken on Sunshine campaign goal was $10.000, which is the same amount Louise is projecting for her campaign.
Louise was also researching musicals in Great Britain, and projecting £4,000 as a budget. Based on similar musicals in GB, Louise’s goal seems to be a little high and out of range of outliers for the amounts pledged. She will need to figure out a way to get her project executed with a lower budget.
